# matlab-fluorescent-particle-image-analysis
This repository houses MATLAB particle image analysis templates developed by Andrew Greytak at the University of South Carolina.

Our repository model consists of "variations" and versions. Variations allow for major new features or coding approaches. Versions allow incremental improvements within a variation. Within each version, you will find folders for:
- "templates": MATLAB scripts
- (possibly) "functions": custom MATLAB functions that can be added to your path and may be called by scripts
- "example data": representative data you can use to learn / test the behavior of the scripts and functions
- (possibly) "resources": additional documentation to explain, support, or develop the project

The "og" variation represents the "original" form of the project and is where development should take place until a new variation is needed. At that time, a naming scheme for variations will be adopted. Versions start with 0.1.
